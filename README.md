# Lecture - Introduction to C++ Classes

This repo demonstrates the evolution of a simple class in C++. We begin by defining a class named `Square` along with a client function (`main`) that utlizes this class. The initial version has inline methods; we then extract these as separate functions defined in `main.cpp`. Finally, we extract these into separate header and implementation files.
